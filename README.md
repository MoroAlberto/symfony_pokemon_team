# Symfony Pokemon team planner

This is a little "for-fun" app 

I sourced the pokemon data from the following sources:

- The general pokemon data came from [The Open Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/).
- The general Pokemon images came from [Veekun](https://veekun.com/dex/media/).

The data from this site comes from the Open PokeAPI, and images come from Veekun. 
I claim no commercial/intellectual rights to these data sets, just merely using them to create something neat and learn about some cool tools.
